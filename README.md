# Flip_It_And_Reverse_It

Abstract: For this assignment, we were asked to break down blocks of code in the Develop folder provided. I was quite excited because this involved geeking out, and reading about exciting things. Finally, we were supposed to explain each line of code. Additionally, we are to provide a Read-Me detailing what we did, in addition to a folder with the code in the develop folder(we're copy/pasting the code from the Develop folder and putting it into a new folder?) Oy. We had the option of a video READ-ME, which I tried several times. However, my hair is very plague-ratchet(adjective), and Gwenom kept walking over the keyboard. Nobody needs to see that. When my hair is big enough to order a big salad with lots of stuff in it again, I shall be comfortable behind le camera. 

Programs Used: Google Fu(is it Fu or Foo.....is it like Foo Fighters, or kung fu?), Google Docs, pexels for my rosey smoke image. 

Acknowledgments: Jerome and Manuel for not killing my extra self. In the words of Britney Spears, "teaching is hard, y'all". No, but seriously..thank you. 

Did I Learn Anything: I learned ALL the things. My Humanities brain was so excited. I get to look up vocabulary words, and accumulate knowledge? Lisa Simpson has nothing on my nerdery. This is a small Read-Me, but I did the things in the Google Docs, and I didn't build anything.
